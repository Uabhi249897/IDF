To replicate a resource, such as an S3 bucket or an EC2 instance, from one AWS region to another using a Python Lambda function, you would generally use the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) : 

Here’s a simplified explanation of how the process works in plain language:

1. Setup Locations:

Choose where you’re getting the files from (source) and where you’re sending them to (destination).
Pick the names of the folders (buckets) where the files are stored.

2. Connect to Both Places:

Set up connections to both the source and destination locations.

3. Handle the Files:

Look at all the files in the source location.
If there are no files, let us know.

For each file in the source:
  Try to move the file to the destination location.
  If the move is successful, note it down.
  If something goes wrong, make a note of the error.

4. Finish Up:

Let us know when the file-moving process is done.
